# 2018 Spring Final Graphics Project  

Period 4

Eric Li, Jackie Woo

## Running 
1. Install Xquartz
2. Clone this repo
3. Run `$make`
4. An image of an airboat will be generated

##  New Functionality  

1. OBJ Mesh Importing

   The graphics engine can now parse through and render .obj mesh images. 
   Simply put the command `mesh:<filename>` after your push and transformations.
   The `.obj` at the end of the filename should not be included.
   It will be in the same place where you draw other shapes such as circles or tori.

   Try out `airboat.mdl`!

2. Basic Shapes

   Four new shapes were added.
 
   * Cone
   * Cylinder
   * Regular pyramid
   * Regular tetrahedron

   Edit the makefile and try out `newshape.mdl`!

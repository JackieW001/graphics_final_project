Period 4

Eric Li, Jackie Woo

## Running 
1. Install Xquartz
2. Clone this repo
3. Run `$make`
4. An image of an airboat will be generated

##  New Functionality  

1. OBJ Mesh Importing

⋅⋅⋅The graphics engine can now parse through and render .obj mesh images. 
⋅⋅⋅Simply put the command `mesh:<filename>` after your push and transformations.
⋅⋅⋅The `.obj` at the end of the filename should not be included.
⋅⋅⋅It will be in the same place where you draw other shapes such as circles or tori.

⋅⋅⋅Try out `airboat.mdl`!

2. Basic Shapes
⋅⋅⋅Four new shapes were added.
⋅⋅⋅* Cone
⋅⋅⋅* Cylinder
⋅⋅⋅* Regular pyramid
⋅⋅⋅* Regular tetrahedron

⋅⋅⋅Edit the makefile and try out `newshape.mdl`!
